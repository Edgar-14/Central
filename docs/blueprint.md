## Core Features:

- Driver Onboarding: Implement a multi-step registration flow for new delivery drivers, including account creation, personal data input, document upload, contract agreement, and training modules, ensuring all steps are completed before submission.
- Digital Wallet: Develop a digital wallet for drivers to view real-time balances and transaction history.
- Admin Dashboard: Build an admin dashboard to manage driver applications, monitor fleet status, and manage financial operations.
- Secure Authentication: Integrate with Firebase Authentication for secure user authentication and authorization, using email/password and custom claims for roles (driver, admin).
- Automated Backend: Use Firebase Cloud Functions to automate backend logic, such as creating initial driver documents on user creation, processing onboarding applications, and updating wallet balances upon delivery completion.
- Role-Based Access: Implement role-based access control to protect driver and admin portals.
- AI-Powered Compliance: Develop a tool that summarizes drivers' submitted documents, ensuring all necessary information is present and compliant, thereby flagging any potential issues to admins, increasing overall speed and accuracy during onboarding.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: BeFast Blue (#1e40af) for primary actions and brand recognition.
- Background color: Light desaturated blue (#e0e5ef), complementing the primary blue and fitting the light color scheme, for most surfaces.
- Accent color: Vibrand Violet (#9a51e0), placed to the 'left' of BeFast Blue on the color wheel, used sparingly for highlights and call-to-action buttons.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral look.
- Use a 'Glassmorphism' style: containers with a semi-transparent, blurred background, rounded borders, giving a frosted glass effect.
- Simple and clean icons for navigation and status indicators.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as loading indicators and form submission confirmations.
